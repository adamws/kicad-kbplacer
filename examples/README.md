# Examples

Each example has own directory with following file structure:

- `kle.json` - keyboard's layout downloaded from [keyboard-layout-editor](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com).
- `kle-internal.json` - keyboard's layout after processing with [kle-serial](https://github.com/ijprest/kle-serial).
  This file is expected by `kbplacer` plugin.
- `keyboard.net` - example's netlist.
- `keyboard-before.kicad_pcb` - PCB file with loaded netlist and parts placed
  at default location (by KiCad's netlist loader). This file is useful for manual
  testing of plugin's code changes.
- `keyboard-after.kicad_pcb` - PCB file after running plugin. Demonstrates
  current capabilities - this file does not contain any manual changes.
- `fp-lib-table` - footprints location file, points to external footprints
  stored in parent's `examples.pretty` directory.
- `keyboard-layout.png` - picture of keyboard-layout-editor layout.
- `render.svg` - picture of PCB, this file is created by KiCad's SVG export.

Elements with different rotation, like `D3` and `D4` are not routed. Placement is ok but some traces need to be added manually.                                                                                            |

This custom diode position would not work with automatic switch-diode routing algorithm implemented by the plugin.                                              |

Note that this footprint has multiple pads of the same nets. Track template from `SW1` was copied for all of them. |
